This program tests a linear regression model on the `superstore.csv` file. To run it, simply click the run button on `profit.py`.

Note that the resulting model is NOT effective, as demonstrated by its mean standard error; however, this is a useful metric to prove that the profit of a company is not linearly related to its numerical inputs.
